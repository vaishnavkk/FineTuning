# Reinforcement Learning for SVM Hyperparameter Optimization in Dementia Prediction
Dementia is a pressing global health concern, underscoring the urgency for accurate and prompt diagnosis to mitigate its impact on individuals and society. Traditional diagnostic methods, reliant on manual assessments and subjective evaluations, often result in delayed interventions and suboptimal patient outcomes. In response, this paper presents a pioneering reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored to enhance classification accuracy in dementia diagnosis. Leveraging machine learning, particularly support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, in conjunction with Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, our RL agent autonomously learns to optimize hyperparameters by iteratively interacting with an environment representing diverse hyperparameter configurations. Through continuous learning on a training dataset, the RL agent refines its policy for hyperparameter selection, leading to refined diagnostic performance. Empirical evidence underscores the efficacy of our RL approach in dementia diagnosis. Extensive evaluations on a comprehensive dataset comprising clinical data of dementia patients demonstrate the superior classification accuracy achieved by the optimized SVM model compared to conventional methods. Sensitivity analyses and comparative assessments with existing approaches further validate the robustness and superiority of our RL framework. This research contributes to advancing medical diagnostics by introducing an innovative methodology that seamlessly integrates machine learning with reinforcement learning techniques and hyperparameter optimization strategies. The proposed framework not only promises to enhance diagnostic accuracy but also holds the potential to facilitate earlier detection of dementia, thereby improving patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.
